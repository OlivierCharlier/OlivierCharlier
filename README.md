## Welcome to my GitHub Profile ðŸ“œ


I am **Olivier Charlier**, a continious learner.

<ins>Take a look at my history</ins>  
_I started around the year 2000: trying to code with [MS Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word) and [MS Outlook Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlook_Express "a discontinued email and news client included with Internet Explorer versions 3.0 through to 6.0.")  when I (by chance) discovered the source code of an email. It was a bit of a disaster, you can imagine. So, 10 years later, I created my first website using [Wordpress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress). And 10 years after, I decided to make Web Development my job! I publish professional websites before and, now, I learn several languages during my training at_ âœ¨ **BeCode** (LiÃ¨ge - Belgium) âœ¨ : _7 months of practice._

ðŸ”­ Currently, I am training to
- optimize my use of **WordPress**
- improve **SEO**
- practice of **Digital Marketing**
